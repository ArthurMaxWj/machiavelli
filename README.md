# README -- prototype
Machiavelli card game implementation for local/single-player and remote versions.

## In progress:
Refactoring specs (use Rubocop Rspec, use factories)

## To-do in the future (maybe):
* use WebSockets/ActionCable instead of AJAX in Remote Sessions (check hosting requirements)
* add frontend/controller tests with Capybara
* maybe use MongoDB?
