<h1>How to play?</h1>
<p>On player turn player can make as many moves as they want as long as at the end all combinations are valid.</p>
<p>Valid combination is either <b>iteration</b> or <b>gradation</b></p>
<p>Gradation is a group of card where each card has the same suit but their value is increasing by exctyly one from left to right.
    Start end end can be arbitrary. Order of cards is as follows: Ace, two to ten, Jack, Queen, King.
    Minimum three cards reqired.</p>
<p>Iteration is a group of cards of the same value but different suits. No duplicates allowed and minimum three cards required.</p>
<p>Examples: <ul>
    <li>3d 4d 5d 6d -- valid gradation</li>
    <li>3d 5d 6d 7d -- NOT valid gradation</li>
    <li>3d 5d  -- NOT valid gradation</li>
    <li>3d 3s 3h -- valid iteration</li>
    <li>3d 3s 3h 3c -- valid iteration</li>
    <li>3d 3s 3s -- NOT valid iteration</li>
    <li>3d 3s -- NOT valid iteration</li>
</ul></p>
<p>When player cant make a valid move they need to draw card from drawboard.
     When no more card to draw they skip turn which is noted and number of skips displayed at the end of game.</p>
<p>First player that reaches the point of having no cards in their deck wins.</p>
